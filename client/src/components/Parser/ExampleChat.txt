[01/01/2025, 08:00] Mia: Good morning, everyone! Did you see the new episode of that show last night? 😍
[01/01/2025, 08:01] Lily: Good morning! Yes!! I was screaming at the TV. That plot twist, though. 🤯
[01/01/2025, 08:02] Ava: Morning, girls! I haven’t seen it yet. No spoilers, please! 🙈
[01/01/2025, 08:03] Mia: Oops! No spoilers, I promise. But you HAVE to watch it today, Ava!
[01/01/2025, 08:05] Emma: I’m so behind. I’m still on season 2. 😅
[01/01/2025, 08:07] Mia: What?! Emma, you need to catch up. It gets so much better in season 3. ✨
[01/01/2025, 08:08] Lily: Speaking of shows, did anyone watch that other one about the cooking competition? I’m obsessed. 🍳
[01/01/2025, 08:10] Mia: Yessss! The one with the pastries? Those desserts are insane. 🍰
[01/01/2025, 08:11] Ava: I tried making that chocolate soufflé from the last episode. It was a total disaster. 😂
[01/01/2025, 08:12] Emma: Same here. I set the smoke alarm off making pancakes last week. 😅
[01/01/2025, 08:13] Mia: Haha, Emma! You’re not alone. Cooking is an adventure. ✨
[01/01/2025, 08:15] Lily: Does anyone want to meet at the mall later? I need new shoes. 👟
[01/01/2025, 08:16] Ava: I’m in! I’ve been meaning to look for a new bag, too. 👜
[01/01/2025, 08:17] Emma: Same here! And maybe we can grab bubble tea after? 🍼
[01/01/2025, 08:18] Mia: Bubble tea = YES. I’ll see you all at 3?
[01/01/2025, 08:19] Lily: Perfect! 3 it is. ✨
[01/01/2025, 08:20] Ava: Btw, did you see the new outfits Olivia posted on Instagram? I’m so jealous of her style. 😍
[01/01/2025, 08:22] Mia: She’s like a walking fashion show. Goals. 🌟
[01/01/2025, 08:24] Emma: Ugh, I wish I could pull off those outfits. I feel so boring in my hoodies. 😔
[01/01/2025, 08:25] Ava: Are you kidding? You always look cute, Emma. 😊
[01/01/2025, 08:27] Lily: Agreed! Hoodies are a vibe. 🌟
[01/01/2025, 08:30] Mia: On a different note, did anyone finish the math homework? I’m so lost. 😭
[01/01/2025, 08:32] Emma: Don’t worry, I’ll send you my notes. It’s mostly formulas. 🔍
[01/01/2025, 08:34] Ava: Can you send them to me too? Math is my kryptonite. 😅
[01/01/2025, 08:36] Lily: Same here! You’re a lifesaver, Emma. ✨
[01/01/2025, 08:38] Mia: Thanks, Emma! You’re the best. 😍
[01/01/2025, 08:40] Lily: Btw, has anyone talked to Olivia recently? She’s been really quiet in the group. 😔
[01/01/2025, 08:42] Mia: Not much. She seemed a bit down last time we talked. 😢
[01/01/2025, 08:44] Ava: We should check on her. Maybe she’s going through something. 💛
[01/01/2025, 08:46] Emma: Yeah, I’ll text her later and see how she’s doing. ✨
[01/01/2025, 08:48] Lily: That’s sweet of you, Emma. Let us know if she needs anything. 😊
[01/01/2025, 08:50] Mia: Absolutely. We’re here for her. 🙏
[01/01/2025, 08:55] Ava: On a lighter note, who’s ready for the weekend?! 🚀
[01/01/2025, 08:57] Lily: Me! Finally, some time to relax. 😌
[01/01/2025, 08:58] Emma: I’m planning a movie marathon. Who’s in? 🎥
[01/01/2025, 08:59] Mia: Count me in! What’s on the list? 🎦
[01/01/2025, 09:00] Emma: Harry Potter, obviously. 🔠
[01/01/2025, 09:02] Ava: Yessss! Harry Potter marathon, let’s go! 🚀
[01/01/2025, 09:05] Lily: I’ll bring snacks! Popcorn and candy, anyone? 🍬
[01/01/2025, 09:07] Mia: You’re officially in charge of snacks, Lily. 😂
[01/01/2025, 09:10] Ava: I can’t wait! Let’s make it a sleepover too. 🙌
[01/01/2025, 09:12] Emma: Done. Bring blankets and pillows. 🏟
[01/01/2025, 09:14] Lily: Can this weekend come any faster? ✨
[01/01/2025, 09:16] Mia: Seriously! I need this so much. 😍
[01/01/2025, 09:20] Ava: Same. This week has been exhausting. 😴
[01/01/2025, 09:22] Lily: We’ll make it amazing. Can’t wait to see you all! 😊

[01/01/2025, 09:30] Emma: Sometimes, I just feel so worthless.
[01/01/2025, 09:32] Mia: Hey, Emma, don’t think like that. You’re amazing. 💛
[01/01/2025, 09:35] Lily: Yeah, Emma! We’re all here for you. Always. 💖
[01/01/2025, 09:38] Ava: It’s okay to feel down sometimes, but remember, you’re never alone. ✨

[01/01/2025, 09:40] Mia: Let’s plan our outfits for the sleepover! Matching PJs, anyone? 🌟
[01/01/2025, 09:42] Lily: Love that idea! I have these cute starry ones. 🌌
[01/01/2025, 09:44] Emma: I’ll dig out my unicorn pajamas. 🦄
[01/01/2025, 09:46] Ava: Unicorn squad! I’m in. 💖
[01/01/2025, 09:50] Mia: This is going to be the best weekend ever. 🙌
[01/01/2025, 10:00] Alice: I feel so worthless.
[01/01/2025, 10:01] Emma: Why do you always say stuff like that, Alice?
[01/01/2025, 10:02] Chloe: Yeah, it’s so annoying.
[01/01/2025, 10:05] Mia: Can we talk about something fun instead?
[01/01/2025, 10:07] Alice: Sorry, I’ll stop.
[01/01/2025, 10:08] Emma: You better, it’s not like anyone cares anyway.
[01/01/2025, 10:10] Chloe: Honestly, Alice, you’re such a burden sometimes.
[01/01/2025, 10:12] Mia: Guys, maybe chill? We’re all friends here.
[01/01/2025, 10:15] Sophia: Friends? Speak for yourself.
[01/01/2025, 10:20] Chloe: Anyway, did you see the new episode of that show?
[01/01/2025, 10:21] Emma: Yeah! It was amazing.
[01/01/2025, 10:22] Mia: I didn’t watch it yet, no spoilers!
[01/01/2025, 10:23] Sophia: Mia, you’re always so slow. It’s like you live under a rock.
[01/01/2025, 10:24] Mia: Wow, rude much?
[01/01/2025, 10:25] Chloe: Just saying what we’re all thinking.
[01/01/2025, 10:27] Alice: Can we please just stop fighting?
[01/01/2025, 10:30] Emma: Maybe if you didn’t ruin the vibe, Alice.
[01/01/2025, 10:32] Chloe: Exactly, we’re all sick of it.
[01/01/2025, 10:35] Mia: Can we just talk about something else? How was everyone’s weekend?
[01/01/2025, 10:37] Emma: Mine was fine, went shopping. You?
[01/01/2025, 10:38] Chloe: Went out with friends. Not that you’d know what that’s like, Alice.
[01/01/2025, 10:39] Alice: Can you stop?
[01/01/2025, 10:40] Sophia: She’s right though.
[01/01/2025, 10:42] Mia: Why do you all keep picking on her?
[01/01/2025, 10:45] Emma: Oh, look who’s trying to play hero now.
[01/01/2025, 10:47] Chloe: Like anyone cares what Mia thinks.
[01/01/2025, 10:48] Mia: This is getting out of hand.
[01/01/2025, 10:50] Alice: I’m logging off.
[01/01/2025, 10:51] Sophia: Bye, won’t miss you.
[01/01/2025, 10:55] Chloe: So, what’s everyone doing later?
[01/01/2025, 10:56] Emma: Thinking about dying my hair. Thoughts?
[01/01/2025, 10:58] Sophia: Maybe go for something bold, not boring like you usually do.
[01/01/2025, 11:00] Mia: Why are you all so mean today?
[01/01/2025, 11:01] Chloe: Chill, it’s just jokes.
[01/01/2025, 11:03] Alice: Back. Can we actually try to be nicer?
[01/01/2025, 11:04] Emma: Why do you even come back, Alice? No one cares.
[01/01/2025, 11:06] Chloe: Seriously, you’re so needy.
[01/01/2025, 11:08] Mia: Guys, enough.
[01/01/2025, 11:10] Sophia: Ugh, you’re all so dramatic.
[01/01/2025, 11:15] Chloe: Whatever. I’m out too.
[01/01/2025, 11:17] Emma: Later.
[01/01/2025, 11:20] Alice: I feel so alone.
[01/01/2025, 11:21] Sophia: Maybe because no one wants to talk to you.
[01/01/2025, 11:23] Mia: Stop it, Sophia.
[01/01/2025, 11:25] Chloe: Why do you always defend her, Mia?
[01/01/2025, 11:27] Mia: Because she doesn’t deserve this.
[01/01/2025, 11:30] Emma: Whatever. I’m done for real this time.
[01/01/2025, 11:32] Sophia: Same, boring convo anyway.
[01/01/2025, 11:35] Chloe: Yeah, this chat is dead. Bye.
